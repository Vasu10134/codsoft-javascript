# Hello, Readers!  

I recently completed a **Virtual Internship Program** as a **JavaScript Developer** with **CodSoft**. This 4-week internship provided invaluable hands-on experience and enhanced my skills in **JavaScript** and web development.  

## Projects Completed:  
- **To-Do List**  
- **Portfolio**

I am immensely grateful to CodSoft for their guidance and support throughout this program, which helped me achieve this milestone. I look forward to more opportunities to collaborate in the future.
